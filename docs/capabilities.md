# Capabilities

Exorous is more than just a code completion tool; it's an agent that understands your project and works alongside you to build better software.

## Codebase Intelligence

Exorous builds a deep understanding of your code so you can focus on building features.

- **Ask Questions**: Ask about your codebase architecture, specific implementations, or project conventions.
- **Smart Search**: Find code based on what it *does*, not just the words it uses.
- **Contextual Awareness**: Exorous remembers previous decisions and project-specific rules you've shared.

## Autonomous Problem Solving

Tell Exorous what you want to achieve, and it will handle the heavy lifting.

- **Refactoring**: Ask it to update old code, improve performance, or fix bugs across multiple files.
- **Automation**: Use simple commands to automate repetitive tasks like formatting, testing, or boilerplate generation.
- **Tool Integration**: Exorous can use shells, search the web, and even connect to external services via the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to get the job done.

## Extensibility

For power users, Exorous can be extended with custom automation:
- **Subagents**: Specialized assistants for deep research or code reviews.
- **Hooks**: Run your own scripts automatically at key moments in the development cycle.
