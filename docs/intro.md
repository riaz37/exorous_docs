# Introduction

Exorous is a production-grade AI coding agent designed to handle complex development workflows with high reliability and deep codebase awareness.

## Why Exorous?

Unlike basic coding assistants, Exorous is built for **scale** and **precision**. It doesn't just suggest code; it understands your entire codebase structure, remembers your project-specific decisions, and executes tasks using a robust set of built-in tools.

### Core Pillars

- **Deep Intelligence**: Uses Semantic Search (RAG) and a full Symbol Graph to understand code relationships and dependencies.
- **Persistent Memory**: Remembers project conventions and design decisions across different sessions.
- **Safety First**: Implements granular approval policies and path-based safety checks to ensure responsible execution.
- **Tool-Driven**: Equipped with a wide array of tools for file operations, shell execution, web retrieval, and more.

## High-Level Workflow

Exorous operates in an agentic loop:
1. **Analyze**: Understands the user's objective and researches the codebase.
2. **Plan**: Formulates a detailed technical plan and requests user approval.
3. **Execute**: Makes precise changes to the codebase using its toolset.
4. **Verify**: Tests and validates the changes to ensure correctness.
